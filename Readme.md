## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Each entry (income or expense) is stored as an object:
   ```js
   { id: 1760770184814, title: "Salary", amount: "5000", filter: "Income" }
   ```
2. Data is stored and updated in `localStorage`.
3. The app dynamically refreshes the displayed data after every change.
4. Updates open in a **popup modal** for easy inline editing.
